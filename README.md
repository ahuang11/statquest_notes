2020/02/29 - StatQuest: The standard error
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgt7F6FqDU
1. I learned what the standard error is: essentially, a standard deviation of the mean of bootstrap samples (many samples from the same population)
2. I relearned what sampling with replacement means: e.g. if I have a sample of [1, 2, 8], my first sample could be [1, 2, 2] (repeated sampling of the same measurement), and my second sample can be [2, 2, 2]
